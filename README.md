# Named-Entity-Recognition

Named Entity means anything that is a real-world object such as a person, a place, any organisation, any product which has a name. For example – “My name is Aman, and I and a Machine Learning Trainer”. In this sentence the name “Aman”, the field or subject “Machine Learning” and the profession “Trainer” are named entities.

In Machine Learning Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a task of Natural Language Processing to identify the named entities in a certain piece of text.

But it does not do anything with the named entities, as it is also using the same technique. In this article, I will take you through the task of Named Entity Recognition (NER) with Machine Learning.
